#
# Ensures the encrypted vault is set up and unlocked BEFORE
# Chromium ever launches, so boot.html can read master-seed.json.
#
# Boot sequence:
#   1. If vault already mounted (Chromium relaunch) → launch browser
#   2. Mount data partition, check for .setup_complete state marker
#   3. If marker MISSING (first boot):
#      → run setup-vault (vault creation + OS hardening + reboot)
#      → system reboots, this script never reaches step 4
#   4. If marker EXISTS (subsequent boots):
#      → run unlock-vault (passphrase prompt → decrypt → mount)
#   5. Launch Chromium with boot.html
#
# Called from: /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart

# NOTE: We intentionally do NOT use `set -e`. Child scripts (unlock-vault,
# setup-vault) return non-zero on user cancellation and wrong passwords,
# which are normal flow — not fatal errors. We handle every exit path
# explicitly with if/then checks.

#
# STRICT single-quoted heredoc: bash performs ZERO expansion on the
# body, so every backslash / backtick / dollar sign is passed through
# literally. Do NOT convert to double quotes or `echo -e` — that will
# break the ASCII art on real hardware.
#
# RAW-TTY SAFE: Each line is emitted through `printf '%s\r\n'` so the
# output contains an explicit Carriage Return + Line Feed on every
# row. On a raw Linux console where `stty onlcr` is disabled, a plain
# "\n" from `cat` only advances the cursor down one line without
# returning it to column 0 — the classic "staircase effect" that made
# the previous rendering look like `SafeKeepVaul?` because each line
# was offset a few columns to the right of the one above, chopping
# off the right edge of the logo.
#
# Width: every row is ≤80 cols so it does NOT wrap on a standard VGA
# text-mode tty1. This is the SAME slant-font art the systemd
# safekeep-splash.service writes at early boot from
# /etc/safekeep-splash.txt, for visual consistency across the two

    # WIPE WATCHER DAEMON — TWO-PHASE CRYPTOGRAPHIC FACTORY RESET
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The web app (boot.js) cannot delete files from the OS filesystem.
    # To perform a Factory Reset, it silently downloads a trigger file:
    #   /media/.safekeep-vault/seeds/WIPE_TRIGGER.txt
    #
    # This is PHASE 1 of a two-phase cryptographic wipe:
    #
    #   PHASE 1 (here, immediate — best-effort content deletion):
    #     1. Delete master-seed.json (fast rm — browser polls for this)
    #     2. rm -rf codex/, passphrases/, settings/ (best-effort)
    #     3. Clean all remaining files from seeds/
    #     4. Write .wipe_pending flag to the DATA partition (persists)
    #     5. Remove trigger file (signals browser that Phase 1 is done)
    #     6. sync to flush writes
    #
    #   PHASE 2 (next boot, before vault unlock — cryptographic kill):
    #     The boot-time check near the top of this script detects
    #     .wipe_pending, zeroes the 16MB LUKS header (destroying all
    #     keyslots and the volume master key), deletes the vault file,
    #     removes the setup marker, and reboots into first-boot setup.
    #
    # WHY TWO PHASES:
    #   - File-level shred is INEFFECTIVE on SSDs (wear leveling moves
    #     data to new blocks; the old blocks may retain the original
    #     content). Shredding gives a false sense of security.
    #   - LUKS header destruction is the ONLY reliable guarantee:
    #     without keyslots, the volume master key is unrecoverable,
    #     making ALL data inside the LUKS container cryptographically
    #     inaccessible — regardless of what's on the raw blocks.
    #   - Phase 1 provides immediate UI feedback (master-seed gone →
    #     Welcome screen) and best-effort cleanup of plaintext files.
    #     Phase 2 provides the cryptographic guarantee on next boot.
    #
    # CRITICAL: The Transfer Drive (/media/safekeep-transfer/) is NEVER

    # RELIQUARY WATCHER DAEMON — ENCRYPTED BACKUP EXECUTION
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The web app (boot.js) cannot execute shell commands. To create a .7z
    # encrypted backup, it silently downloads a trigger file containing the
    # pre-built 7z command:
    #   /media/.safekeep-vault/seeds/RELIQUARY_TRIGGER.json
    #
    # This background loop watches for that file and, when found:
    #   1. Validates the transfer drive is actually mounted and writable
    #   2. Validates that 7z (p7zip-full) is installed
    #   3. Extracts and executes the shell command from the trigger
    #   4. Writes a result file for the web app to poll:
    #      /media/.safekeep-vault/seeds/RELIQUARY_RESULT.json
    #      → { "ok": true, "filename": "Safekeep_backup_2026-04-07.7z" }
    #      → { "ok": false, "error": "Transfer drive not mounted" }
    #   5. Cleans up trigger + result after the web app acknowledges
    #
    # CRITICAL: The 7z command writes ONLY to /media/safekeep-transfer/
    # (the exFAT transfer partition). It reads from the encrypted vault.
    # The trigger/result files live in the vault seeds dir (LUKS-encrypted).

    # RESTORE WATCHER DAEMON — RELIQUARY INSPECT & COMMIT
    # -------------------------------------------------------------------
    # Handles the two-phase restore flow triggered from the Reliquary UI:
    #
    # Phase 1 — INSPECT: Extracts a .7z archive from the USB transfer drive
    #   into /tmp/reliquary, probes the contents, and returns a manifest
    #   describing what the archive contains (codex, settings, cipher, seed).
    #   Trigger:  RESTORE_INSPECT.json
    #   Result:   RESTORE_INSPECT_RESULT.json
    #
    # Phase 2 — COMMIT: Copies the extracted contents from /tmp/reliquary
    #   into the encrypted LUKS vault directories. Supports "merge" (overlay)
    #   and "overwrite" (wipe-then-copy) modes.
    #   Trigger:  RESTORE_COMMIT.json
    #   Result:   RESTORE_COMMIT_RESULT.json
    #
    # Both phases use the same trigger-file watcher pattern as the
    # Reliquary export (RELIQUARY_TRIGGER.json) and Factory Reset
    # (WIPE_TRIGGER.txt) watchers.

# FACTORY RESET COMPLETION — LUKS HEADER DESTRUCTION (Phase 2)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# If a previous session initiated a Factory Reset, the Wipe Watcher
# wrote a .wipe_pending flag to the persistent data partition. We now
# complete the wipe by destroying the LUKS vault entirely.
#
# CRITICAL: This block handles its OWN data partition mounting.
# It does NOT rely on any prior mount — the earlier mount may fail
# silently (no set -e), leaving $DATA_MOUNT pointing at the casper
# overlay tmpfs where .wipe_pending is invisible. To guarantee
# detection, Phase 2 mounts the partition independently and verifies
# every step with diagnostic logging.
#
# WHY TWO PHASES?
#   Phase 1 (previous session): Best-effort file deletion + flag write.
#     The wipe watcher deletes master-seed.json, codex/, passphrases/,
#     and signals the browser. But this can be interrupted by poweroff,
#     and shred is ineffective on SSDs due to wear leveling.
#
#   Phase 2 (this boot): Cryptographic destruction. We overwrite the
#     LUKS header with zeros, destroying all keyslots. Without the
#     keyslots the volume master key is unrecoverable — the remaining
#     ciphertext is random noise. Then we delete the vault file and
#     the setup marker, forcing a fresh vault creation on next boot.
#
# This guarantees data destruction even if Phase 1 was incomplete.
