# setup-vault — First-Boot Initialization & OS Hardening for SafeKeep
# ============================================================================
#
# This script runs ONCE on the very first boot. It performs two operations
# in sequence:
#
#   PHASE 1: Create the encrypted LUKS vault (user password setup)
#   PHASE 2: Scorched-earth OS hardening (network kill, host storage
#            blacklist, printer purge, automount firewall, BadUSB defense)
#
# After both phases complete, it writes a persistent state marker
# (.setup_complete) to the data partition and triggers a mandatory
# reboot so the initramfs-baked module blacklists take effect.
#
# STATE LOCK:
#   The marker file lives at /mnt/safekeep-data/.setup_complete on the
#   ext4 data partition (Partition 4, label "safekeep-data"). This
#   partition is persistent across reboots — unlike the casper overlay
#   (which resets on each boot), files on safekeep-data survive forever.
#
#   safekeep-boot.sh checks for this marker BEFORE calling setup-vault.
#   If the marker exists, setup-vault is never invoked. The heavy
#   initialization (LUKS format, module blacklists, initramfs rebuild,
#   package purge) runs exactly once in the device's lifetime.
#
# EXECUTION:
#   Called automatically by safekeep-boot.sh on first boot.
#   Can also be invoked manually via Ctrl+Alt+S (Openbox keybind).
#
# USB PARTITION MAP (for reference):
#   Partition 1: BIOS Boot   (1MB, raw)
#   Partition 2: EFI System  (100MB, FAT32, label "SK-EFI")
#   Partition 3: OS          (ext4, label "safekeep-os")
#   Partition 4: Data        (300MB, ext4, label "safekeep-data")
#   Partition 5: Transfer    (300MB, exFAT, label "TRANSFER")

# ===================================================================
# NOTE: OS Hardening is applied at BUILD TIME by safekeep-harden.sh.
# ===================================================================
# Module blacklists, udev rules, polkit/dconf lockdowns, systemd
# service masks, CUPS removal, and the initramfs rebuild are all
# performed inside the chroot during `build.sh`. These configs are
# baked into the squashfs and persist across every boot — the casper
# overlay resets, but the read-only lower layer never changes.
#
# This replaces the previous Phase 2 (runtime hardening), which wrote
# to the volatile casper overlay and was lost on every reboot — meaning
# the OS was unhardened on every boot after the first.
# ===================================================================


# ===================================================================
# PHASE 2: MANDATORY SHUTDOWN
# ===================================================================
# A full shutdown (rather than a reboot) after vault creation gives
# the user a clean window to physically remove the USB, plug it into
# another machine, and pre-stage an existing .7z backup onto the
# transfer partition BEFORE powering the vault back on for restore.
# This was impossible with a reboot — the drive stayed hot and the
# user was forced straight into the unlock prompt.
#
# All hardening (module blacklists, dconf, etc.) is baked into the
# squashfs/initramfs at build time and is already active, so no
# second boot is required to enforce security — shutdown is safe.
#
# After the user powers the machine back on:
#   - safekeep-boot.sh runs again
#   - Sees .setup_complete marker → skips setup-vault entirely
#   - Sees .vault.luks exists → runs unlock-vault
#   - User enters passphrase → Chromium launches
# ===================================================================

# Unmount the data partition cleanly before shutdown

# SHUTDOWN FENCE — prevents first-boot race condition
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# `sudo poweroff` returns exit 0 the INSTANT it signals systemd, but
# the OS takes ~10 seconds to actually tear the system down. Without
# a fence, this script returns to its caller (safekeep-boot.sh),
# which falls through to the unlock-vault block and flashes the
# "Unlock Vault" dialog at the user during the shutdown window.
#
# We issue the poweroff request, then `exec sleep infinity` so this
# process is REPLACED with sleep and can never return. When systemd
# brings the system down, sleep is killed cleanly as part of shutdown.
#
# `systemctl poweroff` is tried first (more reliable under set -e
# because it integrates with the unit manager); `sudo poweroff` is
# the fallback. Either way, we fence afterwards — the race condition
# applies to shutdowns exactly as it did to reboots.
